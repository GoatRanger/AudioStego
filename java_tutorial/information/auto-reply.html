Q: Where is the most up-to-date version of the tutorial?
</b>
<br>
A: The official home of the tutorial is always up-to-date:
</p>

<blockquote>
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/</a>
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>
Q: Can I read the tutorial offline?
</b>
<br>
A: Yes, you can either download the tutorial for free or
   get one of the three books based on the tutorial.
</p>

<p>
   Here's the URL for our download page:
</p>

<blockquote>
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/information/download.html">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/information/download.html</a>
     <p>
     <b>Note:</b>
     It's fine to publish the tutorial within your
     intranet, but please don't publish it anywhere on the
     Internet.
     </p>

   <p>
   Book information is here:

<b>
Q: Help! How can I make my first program run?
</b>
<br>
A: If you're having trouble compiling or running your first
   program, find the instructions for your platform by
   going to the following URL:
</p>

     <blockquote>
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/">http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/getStarted/cupojava/index.html</a>
   </blockquote>

   <p>
   This section tells you how to compile and run your first
   application and applet. Thousands of people have followed
   its instructions successfully. If you get a
   NoClassDefFoundError, you probably have a class path
   problem (search for "CLASSPATH").  If you still have
   problems, make sure you're using an interpreter (java or
   appletviewer, for example) that is at least as
   up-to-date as your compiler (javac).
   </p>

Q: &lt;any other question&gt;

<br>
A: We probably won't be able to answer you, so check one of
   the following resources for help:
</p>

<ul>
  <li> The Java Developer Connection (it's free, and it's great!)

       <blockquote>

       </blockquote>

  <li> The Java newsgroups, such as comp.lang.java.programmer,
     comp.lang.java.gui, and comp.lang.java.help. A full
     list, with links to each newsgroup, is on this page:
