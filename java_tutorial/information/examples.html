The Java Tutorial contains hundreds of complete working examples.
Some of our examples are applets, others are standalone applications.
For a complete list of the tutorial's applets,
and what page to visit to run each one,
refer to <a href="../listofapplets.html">List of Applets</a>.
<p>
This page contains four sections that discuss various aspects
of our examples:
<ul>
<li> <a href="#directorynames">Example Directory Names</a>
<li> <a href="#multiples">Multiple Versions of the Same Program</a>
<li> <a href="#applets">About the Applets Running in Our Pages</a>
</ul>

<h3>Example Directory Names</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
Each lesson in the tutorial contains
one or more programming examples,
each of which can be composed of one or more files.
A lesson groups its examples
in sub-directories
according to the version of
the Java 2 SDK required and
whether Swing is required.

<p>
A lesson might have one or more of the following example directories
(from most up-to-date to least):

<p>

<table cellpadding=5 border=1>
<tr>
<th>Example Directory Name</th>
<th>Java 2 SDK Release/Version</th>
<th>Other libraries</th>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example-1dot4</code></td>
<td>Java 2 SDK 1.4</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example-1dot3</code></td>
<td>Java 2 SDK 1.3</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example-1dot2</code></td>
<td>Java 2 SDK 1.2</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example-swing</code></td>
<td>JDK 1.1</td>
<td>JFC/Swing 1.1</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example-1dot1</code></td>
<td>JDK 1.1</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

<tr>
<td><code>example</code></td>
<td>JDK 1.0.2</td>
<td>&nbsp;</td>
</tr>

</table>

<a name="multiples">
<h3>Multiple Versions of the Same Program</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
Often, you can find multiple versions of the same program
by looking in each of the example directories in a lesson.
For example, you might find a JDK 1.0.2 version of a program
in <code>example</code> and a JDK 1.1 version of the same program
in <code>example-1dot1</code>.
<p>
We provide multiple versions of the same program for several reasons:
<ul>
<li>
Some developers can't upgrade to the latest version of the Java 2 SDK
right away because of existing applications and users.
<li>
It's often useful to compare two different versions of the
same program to learn what kinds of changes are required to
migrate from one release to the next.
<li>
Because browser support for applets has historically lagged the
current release of the Java Platform,
we sometimes provide multiple versions of each applet --
one that uses the latest version of the Java 2 SDK,
and one that users can run within less up-to-date browsers.
<li>
Some of the programs have been around since
the original release of the Java 2 SDK (formerly known as the JDK).
Each version of the program represents a step in the
natural migration of the program as the platform evolves.
</ul>

<h3>About the Applets Running in our Pages</h3>
</a>
<blockquote>
Throughout the tutorial, you will encounter running applets.
Our pages use the APPLET tag,
which (for applets that use API introduced after 1.1, at least) requires
Java Plug-in version 1.3.1 or greater.
Most applets are followed by a note like this:

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong> If you don't see the applet running above, you need to install Java Plug-in, which happens automatically when you <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/downloads.html" target="_blank">install the J2SE JRE or SDK</a>. We strongly recommend that you install the latest version; at least 1.3.1 is required for all our applets. You can find more information in the <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/plugin" target="_blank">Java Plug-in home page.</a><hr></blockquote>
