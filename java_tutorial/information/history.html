<strong>Swing Book Release #2, 11 March 2004</strong> &#0151;
<ul>
<li> Added an 
     <a href="../books/swing2e/index.html">information page</a>
     for our just-published book,
     <em>The JFC Swing Tutorial, Second Edition</em>.
     It includes pointers to other pages
     describing and book and CD contents,
     as well as errata.

<li> Added <a href="../uiswing/QandE/questions.html">questions and exercises</a>,
     along with answers,
     to the Swing trail.
     These reflect the Questions and Exercises section
     at the end of every non-reference chapter in the new book.

<li> Updated the
     <a href="../uiswing/components/table.html#sorting">table sorting</a>
     example
     to use a much more recent, functional, and robust version
     of <code>TableSorter</code>.

<li> The usual miscellaneous fixes.

</ul>

<strong>Swing Book Release, 20 February 2004</strong> &#0151;
<ul>
<li> Updated the first two lessons of 
     the <a href="../uiswing/index.html">Swing trail</a> 
     to 1.4 (with notes about what's expected in 1.5):
     <a href="../uiswing/14start/index.html">Getting Started with
     Swing</a> and <a href="../uiswing/learn/index.html">Learning
     Swing by Example</A>.


<li> Throughout the tutorial,
     made the usual fixes to broken links, typos, and other errata.

</ul>

<strong>Maya's Birthday, 3 November 03</strong> &#0151;
<ul>
<li> With the exception of the first two lessons,
     the <a href="../uiswing/index.html">Swing trail</a>
     has now been updated to 1.4 
     (with notes about what's expected in 1.5)
     and reflects what will be published in the upcoming book.
     We'll note the biggest changes here, 
     but with so many changes, we can't mention them all.

<li> After consulting with the Swing engineers,
     we changed our thread safety recommendations
     and updated all but a few straggling 1.4 Swing examples 
     to be thread safe.
     The newest recommendation is this:
     <b>Build the GUI on the event-dispatching thread.</b>
     See 
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/threads.html">How to Use Threads</a> 
     for details.

<li> Updated all pages in the Swing
     <a href="../uiswing/layout/index.html">layout</a>
     and 
     <a href="../uiswing/events/index.html">events</a>
     lessons to 1.4.

<li> Updated the accessibility, actions, threads, and timer pages in the 
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/index.html">Using Other Swing Features</a>
     lesson to 1.4.

<li> In the 
     <a href="../uiswing/components/index.html">Using Swing Components</a>
     lesson,
     updated the applet, root pane, spinner, split pane, tabbed pane,
     table, tool bar, tool tip, tree, and all text component pages
     to 1.4.  Created pages for separators and formatted text fields.

<li> Completely rewrote the <a href="../uiswing/14painting/index.html">painting</a>
     lesson.
     Instead of featuring only the API in the <code>Graphics</code> class,
     it now simply tells you what's special about painting Swing components
     and refers you to the 2D trail for details.

<li> Throughout the tutorial,
     made the usual fixes to broken links, typos, and other errata.

</ul>

<strong>Victoria Day (Canada), 19 May 03</strong> &#0151;
<ul>
<li> Added two completely new and
     much-requested pages to the Swing part of the tutorial:
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/dnd.html">How to Use Data Transfer</a>
     (which covers drag and drop and cut/copy/paste) and
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/focus.html">How to Use the Focus Subsystem</a>.
     Many thanks to Shannon Hickey and Scott Violet for their reviews
     of these rather long and technically complex sections.
<li> Drastically changed the text and examples for
     <a href="../uiswing/layout/spring.html">How to Use SpringLayout</a>.
     It's still unfinished, but should now be more useful.
     Many of the 
     <a href="../uiswing/layout/spring.html#eg">examples</a>
     use a <code>SpringUtilities</code> class
     that makes it easy to build grids of cells,
     including columns of label-text field pairs.
<li> Updated the following Swing component reference pages to 1.4:
     <a href="../uiswing/components/list.html">lists</a>,
     <a href="../uiswing/components/panel.html">panels</a>,
     <a href="../uiswing/components/progress.html">progress bars</a>,
     <a href="../uiswing/components/menu.html">menus</a>,
     <a href="../uiswing/components/scrollpane.html">scroll panes</a>, and
     <a href="../uiswing/components/slider.html">sliders</a>.
     Added a list of examples to the
     <a href="../uiswing/components/formattedtextfield.html#eg">formatted
     text field</a> section.
<li> Updated a couple of other Swing reference pages to 1.4:
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/border.html">borders</a>,
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/icon.html">icons</a>.
<li> Updated applet tags throughout the tutorial to use <code>APPLET</code>
     instead of <code>OBJECT</code>/<code>EMBED</code>.
     This should make them execute successfully in
     recent versions of Java Plug-in.
     Changed a couple of applets to use <code>getResourceAsStream</code>
     instead of <code>getResource</code> to load their images &#151;
     this is more efficient for applets using Java Plug-in.
<li> Throughout the Swing examples,
     invoked <code>setOpaque(true)</code> on
     <code>JPanel</code>s used as content panes,
     to account for the fact that 
     panels are no longer opaque by default 
     in every look and feel we distribute.
     (GTK+, added in 1.4.2, has transparent panels.)
     Where possible, changed examples that use
     <code>p = new JPanel(); p.setLayout(l)</code>
     to use <code>p = new JPanel(l)</code>,
     to avoid the unnecessary creation
     of <code>FlowLayout</code> objects.
<li> Rewrote and reorganized much of the early part of the 
     <a href="../uiswing/components/index.html">Swing components</a> lesson.
     This included adding two new pages,
     with some new material and some extracted from other pages:
     <a href="../uiswing/components/html.html">Using HTML in Swing Components</a>
     and
     <a href="../uiswing/components/model.html">Using Models</a>.
<li> Miscellaneous fixes to broken links, typos, and the like.
</ul>

<strong>Year of the Black Sheep (China), 3 February 03</strong> &#0151;
<ul>
<li> Reorganized and updated 
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/plaf.html">Setting the Look and Feel</a>. 
     It even has information on the GTK and Windows XP look and feels,
     which will be introduced in 1.4.2.
<li> Added source code for the 
     <a href="../uiswing/events/example-1dot4/index.html">1.4 events demos</a>.
     We had released the demos in runnable form soon after our last update,
     but without the source code.
<li> Updated the following pages in the components lesson 
     to reflect 1.4 (and make any other improvements we could):
     <a href="../uiswing/components/jcomponent.html">JComponent</a>,
     <a href="../uiswing/components/button.html">button</a>,
     <a href="../uiswing/components/combobox.html">combo box</a>,
     <a href="../uiswing/components/colorchooser.html">color chooser</a>,
     and
     <a href="../uiswing/components/frame.html">frame</a>.
<li> Updated/added examples in the components lesson.
     New demo: 
     <a href="../uiswing/components/example-1dot4/index.html#FrameDemo2">FrameDemo2</a>.
     Added PNG support to 
     <a href="../uiswing/components/example-1dot4/index.html#FileChooserDemo2">FileChooserDemo2</a>.
     Changed 
     <a href="../uiswing/components/example-1dot4/index.html#ListDemo">ListDemo</a>
     to not add a person if they already exist.
     Added a text input dialog to 
     <a href="../uiswing/components/example-1dot4/index.html#DialogDemo">DialogDemo</a>. 
<li> Fixed the
     <a href="../java/javaOO/QandE/creating-answers.html">Creating Classes answer page</a>
     to actually contain answers.
<li> Updated our standard headers and footers to be more usable
     by people with disabilities.  These changes should be invisible
     to our other readers.
<li> Miscellaneous fixes to broken links, typos, and the like.
</ul>


<strong>Onion Market Day (Switzerland), 25 November 02</strong> &#0151;
<ul>
<li> We changed our external links to bring up new, blank windows
     instead of named windows.  Although this might result in
     an excess of windows, it should solve the problem of people
     losing the named windows.

<li> We added many 1.4 examples to two of the Swing trail's lessons:
     <a href="../uiswing/components/example-1dot4/index.html">Using Swing Components</a>
     and 
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/example-1dot4/index.html">Using Other Swing Features</a>.
     These examples can be launched using
     Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Web Start,
     and the source files now list what other files they need.
     The overall 
     <a href="../uiswing/examples.html">Swing example index</a>
     now points to all versions of the examples for each lesson.

<li> We added a page on
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/keybinding.html">key bindings</a>
     to the Using Other Swing Features lesson.
     We also updated the 
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/action.html">action</a>
     and
     <a href="../uiswing/misc/access.html">accessibility</a> pages.

<li> In the <a href="../uiswing/components/index.html">Swing components</a>
     lesson,
     we changed the order of the pages and updated all the pages
     up through and including buttons.

<li> We're still in the process of updating the
     <a href="../uiswing/index.html">Creating a GUI with JFC/Swing</a> trail to 
     1.4.
     You might notice some changes or notes about changes we plan to make.

<li> We added a 
     <a href="javawebstart.html">Java Web Start</a> page
     to help people install and use that software.

<li> Miscellaneous fixes to broken links and typos.
</ul>   

<strong>Robinson Crusoe's Birthday, 30 September 02</strong> &#0151;
<ul>
<li>We added a <b>new lesson!</b> <a href="../extra/regex/index.html">Regular Expressions</a> 
     covers the <code>java.util.regex</code> API introduced in the  
    <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4/download.html">1.4 release</a> of the
     Java<SUP><FONT="-2">TM</FONT></SUP> 2 Platform Standard Edition. 
     Regular expressions can be used as a tool to search, edit, or manipulate text or 
    data. This package uses Perl-like syntax,
    but our lesson doesn't assume that you've had previous experience with 
    regular expressions. 

<li> The Tutorial <b>front page has completely changed</b>, 
     and the 
     <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/">java.sun.com</a>
     one now looks different from
     the downloaded one.
     The content of the two pages remains nearly identical.
<li> We added a <b>search box</b> to the
     <a href="../index.html">Tutorial front page.</a> 
<li> We retired the <b>Servlets</b> trail, since it's out of date
     and other tutorials have updated servlet coverage.
     For links to the newer coverage
     and to a downloadable form of the old trail,
     see <a href="../servlets/index.html">the old trailhead.</a>
<li> We added a page of <b>printing tips</b>:
     <a href="../2d/problems/printing.html">Improving Printing
     Performance.</a>  It includes strategies that you can use starting
     in both 1.3 and 1.4.1.
<li> We added a file describing the <b>license for our code examples</b>.
     Unless otherwise licensed, all our code is available under this
     <a href="license.html">license.</a>
<li> Notice is hereby given: We plan to 
     <b>retire the <a href="../trailmap.html">Trail Map</a></b>.
<li> We're in the process of updating the
     <a href="../uiswing/index.html">Creating a GUI with JFC/Swing</a> trail to 
     1.4.
     You might notice some changes or notes about changes we plan to make.

<strong>Saturnalia, 22 December 97</strong>
<blockquote>
        <strong><em>The long awaited update!</em></strong> &#0151;
        this is a <em>major</em> update of the tutorial.
        Almost every file has been touched in some way.
        <p>
        This release of the online tutorial corresponds with the
        release of the 2nd edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> book
        and is the version of the online tutorial that appears on
        the CD-ROM that accompanies that book.
        <p>
        The changes are in progress, but to a large extent
        we have integrated 1.1 information into
        the existing trails, lessons, and examples. This is
        in sharp contrast to the 1.1 notes that were littered
        throughout the previous version of the tutorial and
        were, admittedly, somewhat confusing.
        <p>
        Also, we are in the process of integrating copyedit and
        other changes made to the book version, into the online version.
        This has been completed thoroughly in some areas of the online
        tutorial, and spottily in other areas. We will continue
        with this process throughout the coming months.

        <p>
        New lessons in this tutorial that first appeared in print
        in the 2nd edition of <em>The Java Tutorial</em> book:
        <ul>
        <li>
        <strong>The Java Phenomenon</strong>
        <li>
        <strong>Migrating to 1.1</strong>
        <li>
        <strong>A Preview of Things to Come</strong>
        </ul>

        New trails for this version of the tutorial
        that haven't yet made it to print:
        <ul>
        <li>
        Added a <strong>Putting It All Together</strong> trail
        that provides a large, real-world, client/server example and analyzes it.
        <li>
        Got a totally new <strong>JavaBeans Tutorial</strong>
        by Andy Quinn!
        </ul>
</blockquote>

<strong>8 July 97</strong>
<ul>
<li> One of the goals of the tutorial is to document the latest and greatest
     from JavaSoft <em>as it is released</em>.
     To this end, we've added a lesson about
     <strong>Using Swing Components</strong>.
     The Swing release is an early release of part of the JFC.
     This information is only available from the Java Tutorial.
<li> Added a trail, <strong>Java Security 1.1</strong>,
     covering the new 1.1 security APIs.
<li> Updated the The JavaBeans(tm) Tutorial by Greg Voss.
<li> Promoted <strong>Writing Global Programs</strong> to
     a trail. This trail is still in progress, but it contains new material
     including several excellent demos from
     <strong>Taligent</strong>.
<li> Added information about the 1.1 release in our
     <strong>To 1.1 &#0151; And Beyond!</strong> trail.
<li> Made the usual fixes to broken links, typos, and other errata.
</ul>

</blockquote>

<p>
<strong>28 April 97</strong>
<blockquote>
We added a new trail,
<strong>To 1.1 &#0151; And Beyond!</strong>,
which is the headquarters for features added to the JDK after 1.0.
Also, the <strong>Learning the Java Language</strong>
and <strong>Essential Java Classes</strong> trails
now have notes that point out material that is affected by 1.1.
And finally, we reorganized our top-level files to make them more
accessible.
</blockquote>

<strong>3 March 97</strong>
<blockquote>
Added a brand new trail introducing JavaBeans!
This trail, JavaBeans Tutorial, written by Greg Voss,

This draft is the version on which the book version is based.
The book and online versions aren't exactly the same &#0151;
for example, none of the copyeditor's changes 
have made it into the online tutorial yet.
