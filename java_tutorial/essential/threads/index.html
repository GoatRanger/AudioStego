<b>Trail</b>: Essential Java Classes

<h2>
Lesson: Threads: Doing Two or More Tasks At Once
</h2>
<blockquote>
Below are three copies of an applet that animates different
sorting algorithms. No, this lesson is not about sorting algorithms.
But these applets do provide a visual aid to understanding a powerful
capability of the Java<font size=-2><sup>TM</sup></font> platform--threads.
<pre>
                    <strong>Bi-Directional</strong>
<strong>Bubble Sort</strong>         <strong>Bubble Sort</strong>        <strong>Quick Sort</strong>
<applet codebase=example code=SortItem.class width=100 height=100><param name="alg" value="BubbleSort">
</applet>     <applet
codebase=example code=SortItem.class width=100 height=100><param name="alg" value="BidirectionalBubbleSort"></applet>     <applet
codebase=example code=SortItem.class width=100 height=100><param name="alg" value="QSort"></applet>
</pre>

Now start each of the applets, one by one, by clicking on
them with the mouse. 
You can see each applet working its way through the data, sorting it, with
shorter lines on top and longer lines on bottom.
While the applets are
sorting, also notice that you can scroll the page
or bring up one of your browser’s panels.
All this is due to <em>threads</em>. 


</blockquote>
<h3><a href=definition.html>What Is a Thread?</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
A thread--sometimes called an <em>execution context</em> or
a <em>lightweight process</em>--is a single sequential flow of control
within a program.
You use threads to isolate tasks. When you run one of these sorting
applets, it creates a thread that performs the sort operation. Each
thread is a sequential flow of control within the same program (the
browser). Each sort operation runs independently from the others, but
at the same time.

</blockquote>
<h3><a href=timer.html>Using the Timer and TimerTask Classes</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
Thread programming can be tricky.
Whenever possible, you should use high-level thread API
such as the <code>java.util.Timer</code> class
introduced in version 1.3 of the Java platform.
<code>Timer</code> and its companion class,
<code>TimerTask</code>,
are useful when your program
must perform a task repeatedly
or after a delay.


</blockquote>
<h3><a href=customizing.html>Customizing a Thread's run Method</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
Basic support for threads in all versions of the Java platform is in the 
<code>java.lang.Thread</code> class.
It provides a thread API and all the generic
behavior for threads.
These behaviors include starting, sleeping, running,
yielding, and having a priority.
To implement a thread using the <code>Thread</code> class,
you need to provide it with a <code>run</code> method
that performs the thread’s task.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=lifecycle.html>The Life Cycle of a Thread</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
Once you know how to get a <code>Thread</code> to
do something, you need to understand its life cycle.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=priority.html>Understanding Thread Priority</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
A thread's priority affects when it runs in relation to
other threads. This section talks about how
this affects your programs.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=multithreaded.html>Synchronizing Threads</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
The first sample programs in this lesson use either one thread or
multiple threads that run asynchronously. However, it is often useful
to use multiple threads that share data and therefore must synchronize
their activities. In this section you will learn how to
synchronize threads and how to avoid problems such as starvation and
deadlock.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=group.html>Grouping Threads</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
This section shows you how to group threads and what you can do with a
group of threads.
</blockquote>

<h3><a href=summary.html>Summary</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>
When you've completed this lesson on threads, you will have toured the
intricacies of threads in the Java platform,
including the life cycle of a thread
(as represented by its state), scheduling, thread groups, and synchronization.
The Java platform supports multithreaded programs through the
language, the libraries, and the runtime system. This summary page highlights
the features in the Java platform that support threads
and gives you links to further documentation about those features.
