<h2>
Using Package Members
</h2>
<blockquote>
Only public package members are accessible outside the package 
    in which they are defined. To use a public package member from 
    outside its package, you must do one or more of the following: 

    <UL>
      <LI>Refer to the member by its long (qualified) name
      <LI>Import the package member
      <LI>Import the members entire package
    </UL>
Each is appropriate for different situations, as explained 
    in the following sections. 

</blockquote>
<h3>Referring to a Package Member by Name</h3>
<blockquote>
So far, the examples in this tutorial have referred to classes 
    and interfaces by their simple names, such as <CODE>Rectangle</CODE> 
    and <CODE>StockWatcher</CODE>. You can use a package members 
    simple name if the code you are writing is in the same package
    as that member or if the members package has been imported. 
    <P>
    However, if you are trying to use a member from a different package 
    and that package has not been imported, you must use the members 
    qualified name, which includes the package name. This is the 
    qualified name for the <CODE>Rectangle</CODE> class declared 
    in the <CODE>graphics</CODE> package in the previous example: 
<blockquote><pre>
graphics.Rectangle
</pre></blockquote>
You could use this long name to create an instance of
<code>graphics.Rectangle</code>:
<blockquote><pre>
graphics.Rectangle myRect = new graphics.Rectangle();
</pre></blockquote>
You'll find that using long names is okay for one-shot uses. But you'd
likely get annoyed if you had to write <code>graphics.Rectangle</code>
again and again. Also, your code would get very messy and difficult to read.
In such cases, you can just import the member instead.
</blockquote>

<h3>Importing a Package Member</h3>
<blockquote>
To import a specific member into the current file, put an 
    <CODE>import</CODE> statement at the beginning of your file before 
    any class or interface definitions but after the <CODE>package</CODE> 
    statement, if there is one. Here's how you would import the <CODE>Circle</CODE> 
    class from the <CODE>graphics</CODE> package created in the previous 
    section: 
<blockquote><pre>
import graphics.Circle;
</pre></blockquote>
Now you can refer to the <code>Circle</code> class by its simple name:
<blockquote><pre>
Circle myCircle = new Circle();
</pre></blockquote>
This approach works well if you use just a few members from 
    the <CODE>graphics</CODE> package. But if you use many classes 
    and interfaces from a package, you can import the entire package. 
</blockquote>

<h3>Importing an Entire Package</h3>
<blockquote>
To import all the classes and interfaces contained in a particular 
    package, use the <CODE>import</CODE> statement with the asterisk 
    <CODE>(*)</CODE> wildcard character: 
<blockquote><pre>
import graphics.*;
</pre></blockquote>

Now you can refer to any class or interface
in the <code>graphics</code> package by
its short name:
<blockquote><pre>
Circle myCircle = new Circle();
Rectangle myRectangle = new Rectangle();
</pre></blockquote>
The asterisk in the <CODE>import</CODE> statement can be used 
    only to specify all the classes within a package, as shown here. 
    It cannot be used to match a subset of the classes in a package. 
    For example, the following does not match all the classes in 
    the <CODE>graphics</CODE> package that begin with <CODE>A</CODE>: 
<blockquote><pre>
import graphics.A*;	// <em>does not work</em>
</pre></blockquote>
Instead, it generates a compiler error. With the <CODE>import</CODE> 
    statement, you can import only a single package member or an 
    entire package. <P>
    For your convenience, the Java runtime system automatically imports 
    two entire packages:
    </P>
    <UL>
      <LI>The <CODE>java.lang</CODE>package
      <LI>The current package by default
    </UL>
</blockquote>

<h3>Disambiguating a Name</h3>
<blockquote>
If by some chance a member in one package shares the same 
    name with a member in another package and both packages are imported, 
    you must refer to each member by its qualified name. For example, 
    the previous example defined a class named <CODE>Rectangle</CODE> 
    in the <CODE>graphics</CODE> package. The <CODE>java.awt</CODE> 
    package also contains a <CODE>Rectangle</CODE> class. If both 
    <CODE>graphics</CODE> and <CODE>java.awt</CODE> have been imported, 
    the following is ambiguous: 

<blockquote><pre>
Rectangle rect;
</pre></blockquote>

In such a situation, you have to be more specific and use 
the members qualified name to indicate exactly which <CODE>Rectangle</CODE> 
class you want:  

<blockquote><pre>
graphics.Rectangle rect;
</pre></blockquote>
