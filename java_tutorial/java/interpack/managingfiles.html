<h2>
Managing Source and Class Files
</h2>
<blockquote>
Many implementations of the Java platform rely on hierarchical 
    file systems to manage source and class files, although <I>The 
    Java Language Specification</I> does not require this. The strategy 
    is as follows. 
<P>
    You put the source code for a class or an interface in a text 
    file whose name is the simple name of the class or the interface 
    and whose extension is <CODE>.java</CODE>. Then you put the source 
    file in a directory whose name reflects the name of the package 
    to which the class or the interface belongs. For example, the 
    source code for the <CODE>Rectangle</CODE> class would be in 
    a file named <CODE>Rectangle.java</CODE>, and the file would be in a directory 
    named <CODE>graphics</CODE>. The <CODE>graphics</CODE> directory 
    might be anywhere on the file system. The figure below shows how 
    this works. 


<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/package1.gif" WIDTH="350" HEIGHT="76" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p><P>
    The qualified name of the package member and the path name to 
    the file are parallel, assuming the UNIX file name separator 
    slash (/): <BR> 

    <P><CENTER>

<P>
    As you may recall, by convention a company uses its reversed 
    Internet domain name in its package names. The fictional company  
    whose Internet domain name is <CODE>taranis.com</CODE> would  
    precede all its package names with <CODE>com.taranis</CODE>.  
    Each component of the package name corresponds to a subdirectory.  
    So if Taranis had a <CODE>graphics</CODE> package that contained  
    a <CODE>Rectangle.java</CODE> 
    source file, it would be contained in a series of subdirectories, 
    as shown below.<BR>

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/package2.gif" WIDTH="420" HEIGHT="127" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p><P>

    When you compile a source file, the compiler creates a different 
    output file for each class and interface defined in it. The base 
    name of the output file is the name of the class or the interface, 
    and its extension is <CODE>.class</CODE>, as shown in the following figure. 

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/package3.gif" WIDTH="520" HEIGHT="133" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p><P>

    Like a <CODE>.java</CODE> file, a <CODE>.class</CODE> file should 
    also be in a series of directories that reflect the package name. 
    However, it does not have to be in the same directory as its 
    source. You could arrange your source and class directories separately, 
    as shown below.

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/java/package4.gif" WIDTH="310" HEIGHT="158" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT=""></center></p>
<P>
    By doing this, you can give the classes directory to other programmers 
    without revealing your sources. <P>
    Why all the bother about directories and file names? You need 
    to manage your source and class files in this manner so that 
    the compiler and the interpreter can find all the classes and 
    interfaces your program uses. When the compiler encounters a 
    new class as its compiling your program, it must be able to find 
    the class so as to resolve names, do type checking, and so on. 
    Similarly, when the interpreter encounters a new class as its 
    running your program, it must be able to find the class to invoke 
    its methods, and so on. Both the compiler and the interpreter 
    search for classes in each directory or ZIP file listed in your 
    class path. <P>



<blockquote><hr><strong>Definition:</strong>&nbsp;
A <I>class path</I> is an ordered list of directories or ZIP files in which to search  
      for class files. 
<hr></blockquote>
<p>
Each directory listed in the class path is a top-level 
    directory in which package directories appear. From the top-level 
    directory, the compiler and the interpreter can construct the 
    rest of the path, based on the package and the class name for 
    the class. For example, the class path entry for the directory 
    structure shown in the previous diagram would include <CODE>classes</CODE> 
    but not <CODE>com</CODE> or any of the directories below <CODE>com</CODE>. 
    Both the compiler and the interpreter construct the path name 
    to a <CODE>.class</CODE> file with its full package name.  

<P>
    By default, the compiler and the interpreter search the current 
    directory and the ZIP file containing the Java platform class 
    files. In other words, the current directory and the Java platform 
    class files are automatically in your class path. Most, if not 
    all, classes can be found in these two locations. So its likely 
    that you don't have to worry about your class path. In some cases, 
    however, you might have to set your class path.
