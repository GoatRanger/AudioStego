How Swing Components Are Displayed
</h2>

If you plan to create custom painting code for a component, 
this section is required reading.
Understanding the concepts in this section
might also help you troubleshoot
if Swing components don't seem
to be displayed correctly.

<h3>
<a name="howitworks">How Painting Happens</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>

When a Swing GUI needs to paint itself &#151;
whether for the first time,
in response to becoming unhidden,
or because it needs to reflect
a change in the program's state &#151;
it starts with the highest component that needs to be repainted
and works its way down the containment hierarchy.
This process is orchestrated by the AWT painting system,
and made more efficient and smooth by the Swing repaint manager
and double-buffering code.

<p>

Swing components generally repaint themselves
whenever necessary.
When you invoke the <code>setText</code> method on a component,
for example,
the component automatically repaints itself
and, if appropriate, resizes itself.
Behind the scenes, 
when a visible property changes
the <code><b>repaint</b></code> method is invoked on the component
to request that it be scheduled for painting.
If the component's size or position also needs to change,
a call to <code><b>revalidate</b></code>
precedes the one to <code>repaint</code>.
The <code>repaint</code> and <code>revalidate</code>
methods are thread safe &#151;
they can be invoked from any thread.

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;Like event-handling code,
painting code
executes on the event-dispatching thread.
While an event is being handled,
no painting will occur.
Similarly, if a painting operation takes a long time,
no events will be handled during that time.
<hr></blockquote>

<p>

Programs should paint only when the painting system tells them to
because each occurrence of a component painting itself
must execute without interruption.
Otherwise, unpredictable results could occur,
such as a button being painted as half pressed
and half unpressed.

<p>

For smoothness, Swing painting is <em>double-buffered</em> 
by default &#151;
performed to an offscreen buffer 
and then flushed to the screen once finished.
You can improve painting performance
by making components opaque when possible,
so that the Swing painting system 
doesn't waste time trying to paint behind these components.
To make a Swing component opaque,
invoke <code>setOpaque(true)</code> on the component.

<p>

Although the painting area available to Swing components
is always rectangular,
non-opaque Swing components can appear to be any shape.
A button, for instance, might display itself
by painting a filled octagon.
The component behind the button 
(its container, most likely) 
would then be visible,
showing through at the corners of the button's bounds.
The button would have to include
special hit detection code
to avoid acting pressed
if the user happens to click its corners.


</blockquote>
<h3>
<a name="methods">The Swing Painting Methods</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>

The painting method you're most likely to override is
<code>paintComponent</code>.
It's one of three methods
that <code>JComponent</code> objects use to paint themselves.
The three methods are invoked in this order:

<ol>
<li> <code>paintComponent</code>
 &#151;  The main method for painting.
     By default, it first paints the background if 
     the component is opaque.
     Then it performs any custom painting.
<li> <code>paintBorder</code>
 &#151;  Tells the component's border (if any) 
     to paint.
     <em>Do not invoke or override this method.</em>
<li> <code>paintChildren</code>
 &#151;  Tells any components contained by this component
     to paint themselves.
     <em>Do not invoke or override this method.</em>
</dl>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;
We recommend that you don't override or invoke
the method that calls the <code>paint<em>Xxx</em></code> methods:
the <code>paint</code> method.
Although overriding <code>paint</code> is legitimate in
non-Swing components,
it's generally not a good thing to do in components that descend from
<code>JComponent</code>.
Overriding <code>paint</code> can
confuse the painting system,
which relies on the <code>JComponent</code> implementation of
the <code>paint</code> method
for correct painting,
performance enhancements,
and features such as double buffering.
<hr></blockquote>

<p>
The following figure illustrates
the order in which each component
that inherits from <code>JComponent</code>
paints itself.
Steps 1 and 2 &#151;
painting the background and performing custom painting &#151;
are performed by the <code>paintComponent</code> method.
Step 3 is performed by <code>paintBorder</code>,
and step 4 is performed by <code>paintChildren</code>

<blockquote>
<table>
<tr valign=top>
<th> 1. background
<br>
(if opaque)
</th>
<th> 2. custom 
<br>painting
<br>
(if any)
</th>
<th> 3. border
<br>
(if any)
</th>
<th> 4. children
<br>
(if any)

[PENDING: We will change the figures
so that green areas in 1 & 2 are a bit bigger --
they should cover the same area as is covered by the black
and green areas combined in 3 & 4.]

<p>

The standard Swing components delegate their look-and-feel-specific painting to
an object called a <em>UI delegate</em>.
When such a component's <code>paintComponent</code> method is called,
the method asks the UI delegate to paint the component.  
Generally, the UI delegate first checks whether the component
is opaque and, if so,
paints the entire background of the component.
Then the UI delegate performs any look-and-feel-specific painting.
The <code>JComponent</code> class 
doesn't set up a UI delegate &#151;
only its subclasses do.
This means that if you extend <code>JComponent</code>,
your component needs to paint its own background
if it's opaque.

<p>

It's an article in

that discusses in depth the intricacies of painting.

<h3>
<a name="example">An Example of Painting</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>

To illustrate painting, we'll use the <code>SwingApplication</code> program.
Here is its GUI:

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/uiswing/14painting/SwingApplication.gif" WIDTH="268 " HEIGHT="119" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="SwingApplication's GUI"></center></p>[PENDING: this snapshot will be updated]

<p>
Here is its containment hierarchy:

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/uiswing/14painting/1jframehier.gif" WIDTH="263" HEIGHT="179" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="JFrame Hierarchy"></center></p>
<P>
When the GUI for <code>SwingApplication</code> is painted,
here's what happens:
<ol>
<li> The top-level container, <code>JFrame</code>, paints itself.
<li> The content pane first paints its background,
     which is a solid gray rectangle.
     It then tells the <code>JPanel</code> to paint itself.
     In most look and feels, 
     the <code>JPanel</code> is opaque by default
     and the content pane's background rectangle doesn't 
     actually appear in the finished GUI,
     being completely obscured by the
     <code>JPanel</code>.

     <hr>
     <strong>Note:</strong>
     It's important that the content pane be opaque.
     Otherwise, messy repaints will result.
     We could invoke <code>setOpaque(true)</code>
     on the <code>JPanel</code> 
     and then make it the content pane.
     This would slightly simplify the containment hierarchy and painting 
     by removing an unnecessary container.
     <hr>
<li> In most look and feels, the <code>JPanel</code> is opaque
     and the first painting it does fills its background.
     Next, it paints its border.
     The border is an <code>EmptyBorder</code>,
     which has no effect except for
     increasing the <code>JPanel</code>'s size
     by reserving some space at the edge of the panel.
     Finally, the panel asks its children to paint themselves.
<li> To paint itself, the <code>JButton</code> paints
     its background rectangle,
     if necessary, then
     the text that the button contains,
     and then its border.
     If the button has the keyboard focus, 
     meaning that any typing goes directly to the button
     for processing,
     the button does some look-and-feel-specific
     painting to make clear that it has the focus.
<li> To paint itself, the <code>JLabel</code> paints its text.
</ol>

In this way, each component paints itself
before any of the components it contains.
This ensures that the background of a <code>JPanel</code>,
for example, 
is visible only where it isn't covered by 
painting performed by one of the components it contains.


</blockquote>
<h3>
<a name="example2">Repainting Transparent Components</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>

When a transparent (non-opaque) component gets a request to repaint itself,
one or more components underneath the transparent component
must also repaint themselves.
For example, assume you set the text on an ordinary label
that's already visible.
In most look and feels, 
the <em>opaque</em> property of labels is <code>false</code>,
so that labels are transparent.
When a transparent label's text changes,
not only must the label paint itself,
but all components that can be seen behind the label
must also paint themselves.
This painting frenzy is kicked off
when the label's <code>setText</code> method
invokes <code>repaint</code>.

<p>
Here is the sequence of painting when 
<code>repaint</code> is invoked on a <code>JComponent</code> such as a label
that is both visible and non-opaque.

<ol>
<li> Code inherited from <code>JComponent</code>
     causes the non-opaque component
     to look through its containment hierarchy
     to find the closest containing component that's completely opaque.
     For example, if the transparent component 
     is a label in a transparent panel
     in a content pane,
     then the label's closest opaque container is the content pane.
<li> The opaque container paints itself.
<li> The children of the opaque container are asked to paint themselves.
     Eventually, the transparent component is painted.
</ol>

You can see from this sequence that 
painting transparent components
is more costly than painting opaque components.
That's why we encourage you to set 
components' <em>opaque</em>
property to <code>true</code> whenever practical.
