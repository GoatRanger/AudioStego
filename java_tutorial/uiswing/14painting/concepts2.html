<h2>
Introduction to Painting Concepts
</h2>
<blockquote>
This section gives an overview
of what you need to know
before you write code that paints Swing components.
It concentrates on the coordinate system, 
including how borders restrict the coordinates available for painting,
and on the <code>Graphics</code> object
passed in to paint methods.
Although most of the API discussed isn't specific to Swing components,
we concentrate on
what <code>JComponent</code>s need.
For information on actually painting,
you should refer to the API documentation for the
<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html"><font color="#8800bb"><code>Graphics</code></font></a><a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=11 height=11 border=0 align="ABSMIDDLE" alt=" (in the API reference documentation)"></a> class and to the

<h3>
<a name="coord">The Coordinate System</a>
</h3>
<blockquote>

Each component has its own integer coordinate system,
ranging from (0, 0) to (<em>width</em> - 1, <em>height</em> - 1),
where <em>width</em> and <em>height</em>
are the size of the component in pixels.
As the following figure shows,
the upper left corner of a component's painting area is (0, 0).
The <em>x</em> coordinate increases to the right,
and the <em>y</em> coordinate increases downward.

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/uiswing/14painting/13ui33.gif" WIDTH="254" HEIGHT="137" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="A component's coordinate system."></center></p><p>


When painting, 
you must take into account not only the component's size
but also the size of the component's border, if any.
For example, a border that paints a one-pixel line
around a component
effectively changes the top leftmost corner 
of the component's non-background painting area from (0,0)
to (1,1) and
reduces the width and the height of the painting area 
by two pixels each (one pixel per side).
The following figure demonstrates this:

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/uiswing/14painting/border.gif" WIDTH="384" HEIGHT="172" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="Remember to account for the component's border."></center></p><font color=gray>
[PENDING: This figure will change to match the previous one better,
and to be clearer and more correct.]
</font>

<p>
You can get the width and height of any <code>JComponent</code>
using its <code>getWidth</code> and 
<code>getHeight</code> methods.
The <code>getSize</code> method
is another option
that works for all <code>Component</code>s.
To determine the border size,
use the <code>getInsets</code> method.
Here is some code that a component might use
to determine the width and height
available for custom painting:

<blockquote><pre>
protected void paintComponent(Graphics g) {
    ...
    Insets insets = getInsets();
    int currentWidth = getWidth() - insets.left - insets.right;
    int currentHeight = getHeight() - insets.top - insets.bottom;
    ...
    ...<em>/* First painting occurs at (x,y), where x is at least
      insets.left, and y is at least insets.top. */...</em>
}
</pre></blockquote>

<p>

To familiarize yourself with the coordinate system,
you can play with the CoordinatesDemo application,
which features a component implemented using
an inner class named <code>CoordinateArea</code>.
The <code>CoordinateArea</code> has
a preferred size of 400x75
and a solid red border that
occupies 5 pixels at the left and bottom,
and 1 pixel at the top and right.
Like any good component,
it starts painting its innards (a 20x20-pixel gray grid)
where the border ends &#151;
in this case, at (5,1).
The <code>CoordinateArea</code> also paints a dot 
where the user clicks.
As you can see from the following figure,
a label at the bottom of the GUI
displays information about the cursor and click location.

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/uiswing/14painting/CoordinatesDemo.gif" WIDTH="410" HEIGHT="124" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="CoordinatesDemo"></center></p>
<blockquote><hr><strong>Try this:</strong>&nbsp;
<ol>
<li> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorialJWS/uiswing/14painting/example-1dot4/CoordinatesDemo.jnlp">Run CoordinatesDemo</a> using
<a target="_top" href="../../information/javawebstart.html">Java<sup><font size=-2>TM</font></sup> Web Start</a><a target="_top" href="../../information/javawebstart.html"><img src="../../images/tutorialIcon.gif" width=11 height=11 border=0 align="ABSMIDDLE" alt=" (in the Creating a GUI with JFC/Swing trail)"></a>.    Or, to compile and run the example yourself,
     consult the
     <a href="example-1dot4/index.html#CoordinatesDemo">example index</a>.

<li> Move the cursor over the <code>CoordinateArea</code>,
     including its red border.
     <br>
     Note the location of the cursor,
     as displayed at the bottom of the window.
     (Until bug #

     it'll be taller.)

<li> Move the cursor to 
     the center of the <code>CoordinateArea</code>
     and click.
     <br>
     A 7x7 dot appears,
     and the label at the bottom of the window
     displays its location, as well as the cursor's current location.

<li> Move the cursor to be near or barely within
     the red border on the left or bottom and click.
     <br>
     The dot that appears looks smaller than 7x7
     because it's obscured by the border.
     The component's painting code paints it fully,
     but because the <code>paintBorder</code> method
     is called after <code>paintComponent</code>,
     the border is painted on top of the dot.
     If the border didn't completely paint over its area
     in an opaque color,
     you would be able to see more of the dot.
</ol>
<hr></blockquote>

<p>
The SelectionDemo example shown in the following figure
is another that can give you a feeling for coordinates.
It paints a continuously updating rectangle,
which the user sets by dragging the mouse.
To avoid unnecessary painting,
the component's mouse-dragged and mouse-released event handler
uses a version of the <code>repaint</code> method
that specifies which area of the component needs to be repainted.

<p><center><IMG SRC="../../figures/uiswing/14painting/SelectionDemo.gif" WIDTH="510" HEIGHT="149" ALIGN="BOTTOM" NATURALSIZEFLAG="3" ALT="More fun with coordinates"></center></p>
You can 
<b><a href=http://javaweb.sfbay/~kwalrath/tutorial/uiswing/14painting/example-1dot4/SelectionDemo.jnlp>run SelectionDemo</a></b>
using 
<a target="_top" href="../../information/javawebstart.html">Java Web Start</a><a target="_top" href="../../information/javawebstart.html"><img src="../../images/tutorialIcon.gif" width=11 height=11 border=0 align="ABSMIDDLE" alt=" (in the Creating a GUI with JFC/Swing trail)"></a>.    Or, to compile and run the example yourself,
     consult the
     <a href="example-1dot4/index.html#SelectionDemo">example index</a>.

<p>
The code is in
<a target="_blank" href="example-1dot4/SelectionDemo.java"><font color="#bb000f"><code>SelectionDemo.java</code></font></a><a target="_blank" href="example-1dot4/SelectionDemo.java"><img src="../../images/sourceIcon.gif" width=11 height=11 border=0 align="ABSMIDDLE" alt=" (in a .java source file)"></a>.
The following snippet
shows how <code>repaint</code>
is invoked by the event handler for
mouse-dragged and mouse-released events.
The handler gets the current cursor location,
updates the selection rectangle,
calculates the total area to be repainted,
and then specifies that area to the <code>repaint</code> method.
Note that the total area to be repainted
is equal to the previously painted area
plus the newly selected area.
This way, it cleans up the previous painting,
avoiding the faux pas of 
leaving behind ghost images of the selection rectangle.

<blockquote><pre>
void updateSize(MouseEvent e) {
    int x = e.getX();
    int y = e.getY();
    <em>...//save previous selection rectangle (rectToDraw)
       //in previousRectDrawn...
       //calculate new values for rectToDraw...</em>
    Rectangle totalRepaint = rectToDraw.union(previousRectDrawn);
    repaint(totalRepaint.x, totalRepaint.y,
            totalRepaint.width, totalRepaint.height);
}
</pre></blockquote>

Here is the code that paints the selection rectangle
on top of the image:

<blockquote><pre>
g.drawRect(rectToDraw.x, rectToDraw.y, 
           rectToDraw.width - 1, rectToDraw.height - 1)
</pre></blockquote>

<blockquote><hr><strong>Note:</strong>&nbsp;The last two arguments
to <code>drawRect</code>
have "- 1"
because the painting system draws lines
just below the specified rectangle,
instead of within the specified rectangle.
The same rule 
of specifying one less than the desired width
applies to other <code>draw<em>Xxx</em></code> methods.
For <code>fill<em>Xxx</em></code> methods,
on the other hand,
you specify exactly the desired width and height in pixels.

<p>
Here are examples of painting two rectangles of
the same size, one filled and one not:

<blockquote><pre>
g.fillRect(x, y, rectWidth, rectHeight);
g.drawRect(x, y, rectWidth - 1, rectHeight - 1);
</pre></blockquote>

<h3>
The Graphics Object and Graphics2D
</h3>
<blockquote>

The
<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html"><font color="#8800bb"><code>Graphics</code></font></a><a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=11 height=11 border=0 align="ABSMIDDLE" alt=" (in the API reference documentation)"></a> object passed into the <code>paintComponent</code> method
provides both a context 
and some methods for simple painting.
In almost every case, <code>Graphics</code> objects
are actually 
<a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html"><font color="#8800bb"><code>Graphics2D</code></font></a><a target="_blank" href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.4.2/docs/api/java/awt/Graphics2D.html"><img src="../../images/apiIcon.gif" width=11 height=11 border=0 align="ABSMIDDLE" alt=" (in the API reference documentation)"></a> objects.
The <code>Graphics2D</code> class
extends <code>Graphics</code>
to provide more sophisticated control
over geometry, coordinate transformations, 
color management,
and text layout.
You can cast any <code>Graphics</code> parameter
into a <code>Graphics2D</code> object
as long as your program 
uses the Java 2 platform (1.2 or later)
and doesn't use the old printing API.

<blockquote><hr><strong>Version note:</strong>&nbsp;The old printing API
is centered around the

it uses <code>Graphics2D</code>.
In 1.4.1, Java Plug-in
printing was updated to use the newer printing API.
<hr></blockquote>
</ul>

<p>
The painting methods defined by <code>Graphics</code>
include such standbys as
<code>drawRect</code>, 
<code>fillRect</code>, and
<code>drawLine</code>.
The <code>Graphics2D</code> class adds more flexible methods such as 
<code>draw(Shape)</code> and
<code>fill(Shape)</code>.

<p>
The graphics context provided by a <code>Graphics</code> object
consists of state
such as
the current painting color,
the current font,
and
the current painting area.
The <code>Graphics2D</code> class
adds more state, such as
the alpha compositing mode,
stroke, rendering hints, and color patterns
such as textures and gradients.

<p>
In <code>JComponent</code>s,
the <code>Graphics</code> object
is initialized
just before it's passed to
<code>paintComponent</code>,
so that its color and font 
are set to the foreground color and font of the component.
The same <code>Graphics</code> object
is then passed to the <code>paintBorder</code>
and <code>paintChildren</code> methods.
This reuse is efficient
but can lead to trouble if painting code
permanently changes the <code>Graphics</code> object's state.
For example, permanently changing the alpha compositing mode 
of a <code>Graphics2D</code> object
could cause the component's border or children to be painted incorrectly.
To avoid problems, remember this rule:

<blockquote>
<hr>
     <b>The <code>Graphics</code> object
     should have the same state when you're finished painting
     as it had when you started.</b>
<hr>
</blockquote>

<p>
You can take two approaches
to avoid permanently changing the <code>Graphics</code> object:
either restore the 
<code>Graphics</code> object's original state,
or use a copy of the original object.
If you take the first approach,
you don't need to bother restoring the font and color,
since those properties are usually set before painting.
Here's an example of the first approach:

<blockquote><pre>
<em>//Example of restoring the Graphics object's state</em>
Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D)g;
g2d.translate(x, y);   //set the transform
...
g2d.translate(-x, -y); //go back to the original transform
</pre></blockquote>

Here's an example of the second approach:

<blockquote><pre>
<em>//Example of copying the Graphics object</em>
Graphics2D g2d = (Graphics2D)g.create(); //copy g
g2d.translate(x, y);
...
g2d.dispose(); //release the copy's resources
</pre></blockquote>

The advantage of the first approach is
that it doesn't create extra objects.
The advantage of the second
is that it's easy and guaranteed to succeed,
no matter how much state you change.

<p>


<p>

When writing your painting code,
keep in mind that you can't depend on
any graphics context except what's provided
by the <code>Graphics</code> object.
For example, 
if you specify a painting area to <code>repaint</code>,
you can't rely on
the same painting area being specified in the next call
to <code>paintComponent</code>.
For one thing, multiple repaint requests can be coalesced 
into a single <code>paintComponent</code> call.
For another,
the painting system occasionally calls <code>paintComponent</code>
on its own, without any repaint request from your program &#151;
for example,
in response to first being shown
or to a window that obscured it being moved.
