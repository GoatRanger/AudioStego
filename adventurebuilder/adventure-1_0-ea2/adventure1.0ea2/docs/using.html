</ul>

<h2>
<b>Demo At A Glance</b></h2>
The early access 2 version of the Adventure Builder demo consists of the
following&nbsp; high level components:
<ul>
<li>
<b>The Adventure Builder Website</b>--Presents the main interface to existing
/ new customers. Customers use this Web site to browse the various adventure
packages that are available, create new accounts as well as book an adventure
package.</li>
</ul>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Web site also
enables the customer to track the status of orders that were placed earlier.
<ul>
<li>
<b>The Order Processing Center (OPC)</b>--Receives and processes customer
bookings by coordinating with various business partners, such as airlines,
hotels, activity providers and so forth.</li>
</ul>

<h2>
Using the Adventure Builder Web Site</h2>

<h3>
Accessing the Adventure Builder Web Site</h3>
Using a browser, access the following URL:
<p><a href="http://localhost:8000/ab">http://localhost:8000/ab</a>
<p>Click the "Start an adventure" link. Note that if the J2EE server is
not running on localhost, you need to replace "localhost" in the URL listed
above with the name of server where J2EE is running.
<h3>
Browsing the Adventure Builder Web Site And Choosing an Adventure</h3>
The home page of the Adventure Builder Web site gives an array of choices&nbsp;
for different categories of available adventures. Clicking these&nbsp;
major categories of adventures displays the specific adventure&nbsp; packages
available for the chosen category. Each adventure is pre-packaged--that
is, each has a default set of lodging and activities. Click the adventure
package of interest to display the details of the adventure along with
the default lodging and activities available with the package.
<p>Click the link "Purchase Package" to go to a Web page where you are
asked to enter package details such as the number of people, number of
days, start date, and number of rooms. Once you choose these details and
click "Continue" a subsequent page lets you specify the city of origin
and choose the mode of transport to the adventure locale. If you plan to
arrange your own transportation, you may do so in this same page. You may
also choose from a set of available flights.
<h3>
Changing Cart Contents</h3>
When you complete the above steps, you see a summary of the package you
have chosen. You can either make more changes (using the links provided)
or choose to confirm the purchase of the adventure package. The Web site
allows you to change the number of nights lodging, the number of people
per activity, and the type of lodging, activity, and&nbsp; transportation
mode. If you want to change the number of people or number of days, choose
the appropriate fields in the "Summary" screen and click the "update" button.
If you want to change the Lodging / Activities / Transportation details,
you may do so using the appropriate links provided.
<h3>
Booking Your Vacation</h3>
Once you have finalized the contents of your adventure package, book&nbsp;
your vacation by clicking the "Checkout" link. Clicking this link&nbsp;
places your reservation for confirmation with the Order Processing (OPC)
component. If you have not&nbsp; yet signed in, you will first have to
sign in (and possibly create a new account) before placing&nbsp; your reservation
for confirmation with the OPC. When you place your reservation, you get
an order id for your reference. Remember that the OPC will try its best
to satisfy your order. If even one of the&nbsp; choices of your order cannot
be confirmed, your order will not go through, and you will be notifed via
email.
<h3>
<b>Tracking Order Status</b></h3>
Track the status of your order by clicking the "Track Order" Link on the
top left of the page and entering the order ID.
<h3>
Sign in or Create New Account</h3>
To sign in as an existing user or create a new user account, click the
"Account" link available at the top left corner of your browser window.
You can either sign in (if you already have an account) or create a new
account (in which case, you will be asked to enter some identifying information).
