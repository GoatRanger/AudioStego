<h1> Customer  Mini-Application </h1>
             This document will briefly describe the Customer mini-application, 
including a description of the requirements, a description of the structure 
and design, and some other design considerations.     
<h2> Requirements and Use Cases</h2>
    
<p>This application allows browser clients to create new accounts by filling
in some fields in a form and submitting the form. The account data will be
persisted in a database. The customer can also view existing accounts by
supplying an account identification key, ID,  and submitting the ID. When
the customer enters a new account or reads the data of an existing account,
they will then view either a page showing the account data, or if there is
an error they will view an error page. </p>
   
<p> Note that this application is very simple and does not handle all scenarios 
of a full application. For instance, it does not provide any security or ability
to sign on or off. </p>

               <br>
      
<h2> Design</h2>
     
<p>    This section will briefly discuss the structure of the application. 
Overall the application architecture follows the <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/MVC.html">
 Model-View-Controller</a>  pattern. The design and implementation follow 
several other patterns. See the BluePrints  <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/index.html">
  patterns page</a>   for detailed information on patterns. All user requests
are directed to a   <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/FrontController.html">
 Front Controller</a> Servlet which processes all requests, interacts with 
the data in the database, and chooses the next page to return to return to 
the customer. The FrontController servlet delegates the processing of creating 
new accounts and reading from existing accounts to the AccountHandler class. 
The AccountHandler reads the fields for the submitted form, acesses the CustomerFacade 
to access the data model, and places the return data in a ResultBean class 
that the ScreenView page, the showaccount.jsp in this case,   uses to populate 
the view. The CustomerFacade is the class responsible for interacting with 
the data model. The data is persisted in a database. Note that the CustomerFacade 
uses the Factory pattern to lookup the type of AccountDAO to use. Since we 
are using a cloudscape database, it returns a DAO for that type of data source 
and the database. So data is access by the CloudscapeAccountDAO class. The 
CloudscapeAccountDAO  has all the JDBC code used to access the cloudscape 
database. This is an example of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/blueprints/patterns/DAO.html">
 Data Access Object</a> pattern.       </p>

                      </td>
                    </tr>
                    <tr>
                      <td align="Left">                     <b>         
           <font size="-1">     Figure 2. UML Class Diagram     </font> 
                   </b>                     </td>
                    </tr>
                     
  </tbody> 
</table>
                </center>
               <br>
      
<h2> Other Design Considerations </h2>
     
<h3> Transactions </h3>
   
<p> This mini-application has very simple transactional needs. The data is 
only updated when a user creates a new account. In J2EE, there are several 
ways to  manage transactions. In this application we just use the default 
capabilities of the JDBC Connection. In J2EE autocommit is set to true by 
default so when a Connection is opened, an SQL operation executed on the Connection,
and the Connection is closed, then the transaction is done automatically. 
  <br>
  </p>
 
<h3> Concurrency </h3>
  The Data Access Object CloudscapeAccountDAO is stateless. It holds no member 
fields and it opens and closes Connections within each method call. In J2EE, 
the Connections are pooled so it does not impact performace to open and close 
a connection. Since the DAO is a stateless object that contains no state
specific to any user, it can be held at application scope and shared by more
than one user.   <br>
