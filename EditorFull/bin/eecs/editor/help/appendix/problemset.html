    <h1>Problem Sets</h1>
    <p>Problem sets are integrated exercises that include a problem description, a
code template, and in some cases a set of test data.  When working in Java,
problem sets are designed to give you some problems to solve that can be
automatically tested, providing immediate feedback on your solution.  Using this
facility, you do not need to generate your own set of test cases or enter input
to see if your solution works--all you need to do is solve the problem and
select <strong>Run Tests</strong> from the <em>Tools</em> menu.</p>
