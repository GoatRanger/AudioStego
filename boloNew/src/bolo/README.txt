By default, this package unzips to D:\bolo.  However,
anyplace that is on your CLASSPATH is fine.

Go to the Samples subdirectory.  Robots have names of the form
RW_<something>.java, such as RW_Kamikaze.java.  Bring up any
robot in JEDPlus and run it.  Pick some robots and hit "Battle!".

To create your own robot, read API.doc in the Samples
subdirectory or come talk to me.
