<H1>Collision applet changes</H1>

<H3>Errata to fix</H3>
<UL>
<LI>The mass control slider is too small and slides off the edge.
<LI>Test the applet on machines slower than a dual PPro 200.  Maybe the
	animation isn't smooth.  It's already double-buffered and threaded, but
	it uses lightweight components.  Native components may have smoother
	animation b/c you can set small clipping regions.
<LI>Support more langauges -- I could at least add German.
</UL>
